# 🚀 Railway Deployment Guide

## 🚂 **RAILWAY** (Primary Deployment Platform)
**Perfect for**: Full-stack apps with databases and background workers

✅ **What I've configured for you:**
- Complete Express.js backend in `/backend` folder
- API routes migrated from Next.js to Express
- Railway configuration (`railway.json`)
- Environment template (`.env.railway.template`)
- PostgreSQL database support
- Background worker support

**Deploy in 3 steps:**

### 1. **Setup Railway CLI**
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login
```

### 2. **Create Railway Project**
```bash
# Initialize Railway project
railway init

# Add PostgreSQL database
railway add --plugin postgresql

# (Optional) Add Redis for background jobs
railway add --plugin redis
```

### 3. **Set Environment Variables**
Copy variables from `.env.railway.template` to your Railway dashboard:
- Go to your Railway project dashboard
- Navigate to Variables tab
- Add each environment variable

**Required Variables:**
```
DATABASE_URL=<automatically provided by Railway>
JWT_SECRET=<generate a secure random string>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your OpenAI API key>
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 4. **Deploy**
```bash
# Deploy to Railway
railway up

# Or connect your GitHub repo for auto-deployment
railway connect
```

**Result**: Your app will be available at `https://your-app.railway.app`

## 📊 **Architecture Overview**

**Railway Deployment Structure:**
```
Railway Project
├── Web Service (Express.js Backend)
│   ├── API Routes: /api/research, /api/health
│   ├── Background Workers
│   └── Socket.IO Support
├── PostgreSQL Database
└── Redis Cache (Optional)
```

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /api/health` - API health check  
- `POST /api/research` - Start research session
- `GET /api/research` - List all research sessions
- `GET /api/research/:sessionId` - Get specific research session

---

## 🔧 **Development**

**Local Development:**
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Or start only backend
npm run dev:backend
```

**Production Build:**
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## 🎯 Quick Decision Guide:

**Choose VERCEL if you want:**
- ✅ Fastest deployment (ready now!)  
- ✅ Best performance (edge network)
- ✅ Serverless scaling
- ✅ No database management needed

**Choose RAILWAY if you want:**
- ✅ Full PostgreSQL database
- ✅ Background workers
- ✅ Traditional server architecture

**Choose RENDER if you want:**
- ✅ Simple, straightforward deployment
- ✅ Good free tier
- ✅ Docker support

## 🏆 My Recommendation: 

**Deploy to VERCEL right now!** 

Your Vercel-optimized version is complete and ready. You can have it live in 5 minutes, then enhance with databases and AI features later.

```bash
cd /workspaces/DeepResearcher
npx vercel --prod
```

The demo will work immediately, and you can add OpenAI API integration, Vercel Postgres, and other features incrementally.
