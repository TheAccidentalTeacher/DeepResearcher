# 🚀 Single-Platform Deployment Guide

## Your Best Options for Single-Platform Hosting:

### 🥇 **VERCEL** (Recommended - Ready to Deploy!)
**Perfect for**: Your Next.js app with serverless API

✅ **What I've created for you:**
- Complete Next.js app in `/app` folder
- Serverless API routes in `/app/api`  
- Vercel configuration (`vercel.json`)
- Tailwind CSS styling
- Production-ready package.json

**Deploy in 3 commands:**
```bash
npx vercel --prod
# Follow prompts to connect your GitHub repo
# Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
```

**Result**: `https://deep-research-assistant.vercel.app`

### 🥈 **RAILWAY** (Great Alternative)
**Perfect for**: Full-stack apps with databases

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Deploy current backend

railway deploy
```

**Auto-deploys** from your GitHub repo with PostgreSQL included.
